## **For New Git and GitHub Users**

Never used Git or GitHub before? No problem! This section will guide you through the basic steps to get started.

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**
- Sign up for a free GitHub account: [Create an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

### **Step 2: Fork the Repository**
1. Go to [TARS-AI on GitHub](https://github.com/pyrater/TARS-AI).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Create a new fork** to make your own copy of the repository. This fork will look like `yourGithubUsername/TARS-AI`.

Why fork? Forking allows you to make changes in your own copy of the repository without affecting the original.

### **Step 3: Install Git Locally**
If you’re new to Git, you’ll need to install it on your local machine.
- Download Git: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Verify the installation by running `git --version` in your command line.

### **Step 4: Secure Your GitHub Account**
- Protect your account with multi-factor authentication (MFA): [Set up MFA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github).
- **Highly Recommended**: Set up an SSH key for secure and streamlined operations: [Generate an SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

### **Step 5: Clone Your Fork**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the repository.
3. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourGithubUsername/TARS-AI.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd TARS-AI
   ```

### **Step 6: Set Up Remotes**
- Check the remote URLs:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
  You should see your fork as `origin`.
- Add pyrater's repository as the upstream remote:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:pyrater/TARS-AI.git
  ```

Why? This setup helps you fetch updates from the main repository to keep your fork up-to-date.

## **Basic Git Operations**
These are the standard steps for making contributions:

### **1. Create a Branch**
Always create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Branches help you isolate changes and organize features.

### **2. Make Changes**
- Add, edit, or delete files in the project.
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g., `add-new-feature` or `fix-bug`.

### **3. Stage Changes**
Stage your changes to prepare them for a commit:
```bash
git add .
```
Optionally, check the status:
```bash
git status
```

### **4. Commit Changes**
Save your changes locally with a meaningful commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

For non-binary files, Git tracks changes for version control. For CAD files like STL or STEP, Git stores the files as blobs without versioning.

### **5. Push Changes**
Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

---

## **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**
Once your changes are ready:
1. Go to pyrater's repository: [TARS-AI](https://github.com/pyrater/TARS-AI).
2. Click **Pull requests** in the top menu.
3. Click the green **New pull request** button.

On the **Comparing changes** page:
- **Base repository**: `pyrater/TARS-AI`, base: `main`.
- **Head repository**: `yourGithubUsername/TARS-AI`, compare: `your-branch-name`.

### **Provide Details**
- Add a meaningful title for your PR.
- Write a clear description of your changes, explaining what they do and why they’re needed.
- Confirm the changed files are correct.

### **Submit the PR**
- Click **Create pull request**.
- Notify pyrater on Discord in the `#repo` channel.

### **Review and Approval**
- Wait for pyrater to review your PR.
- If changes are requested, update your branch locally, commit, and push again. GitHub will automatically update the PR.
- Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations!

## **Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date**
If other contributors make changes to the main repository, keep your fork in sync:
1. Fetch updates from the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. Merge updates into your branch:
   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
3. Push updates to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
